# Base Project

These base Project shows architectural approaches to developing Android apps.

We use:
*   User Interface built with **[Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)** 
*   A single-activity architecture, using **[Navigation Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation)**.
*   A presentation layer that contains a Compose screen (View) and a **ViewModel** per screen (or feature).
*   Reactive UIs using **[Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow)** and **[coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html)** for asynchronous operations.
*   A **data layer** with a repository and two data sources (local using Room and a fake remote).
*   Two **product flavors**, `mock` and `prod`, [to ease development and testing](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2015/12/leveraging-product-flavors-in-android.html).
*   A collection of unit, integration and e2e **tests**, including "shared" tests that can be run on emulator/device.
*   Dependency injection using [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android).
